# ImageClef-Lifelog-2020
The [Image CLEF 2020 Lifelog Task](https://www.imageclef.org/2020/lifelog) is a large-scale multi-label classification task to retrieve several predefined activities in a lifeloggerâ€™s life. Different personal devices, such as smartphones, video cameras as well as wearable devices that allow collection of different data about our daily life are available. Large amounts of data are created by these devices containing videos, images, audio and sensor data.Our goal is to Implement a system to classify a these image first and then match them with defined topics. This reposotory contains an effort to classify those images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Densenet201).
